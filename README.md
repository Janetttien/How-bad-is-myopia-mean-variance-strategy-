The dynamic mean-variance (MV) strategy aims to incorporate future expectations to
optimise portfolio selections with multiple investment horizons. Despite there are
numerous in-depth studies on the dynamic MV framework, most practical investment
strategies still favour the myopic approach over the dynamic one. This dissertation
aims to explore the numerical results of dynamic MV strategy in comparison to the
traditional myopic MV strategy, two extended na√Øve diversification strategies under a
dynamic setting, and the equal-weighted strategy, which serves as the benchmark.
The tests are implemented through out-of-sample metrics across multiple datasets,
without imposing any distributional assumptions on the asset returns.
